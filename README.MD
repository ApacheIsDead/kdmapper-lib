# KDMapper
KDMAPPER-LIB

I've found myself needing to use kdmapper in a more discreet, stealthy way without the exe attached to it. We want the code and the functionality without the bells and whistles.

So i made the KDMapper-lib, which uses the CRUZ variant of kdmapper, but without logs and none of the attaching stuff  but instead a function to specify .sys file path along with different boolean values
like the option to include the PE headers, or free the memory after mapping. Allowing more flexibility and the only library this good so far!
